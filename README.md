_We apply energy-based models p(y|x; theta) to the task of 3D bounding box regression, extending the recent energy-based regression approach from 2D to 3D object detection. This is achieved by designing a differentiable pooling operator for 3D bounding boxes y, and adding an extra network branch to the state-of-the-art 3D object detector SA-SSD. We evaluate our proposed detector on the KITTI dataset and consistently outperform the SA-SSD baseline, demonstrating the potential of energy-based models for 3D object detection._
